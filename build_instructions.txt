
1) Rez rigged bum, name it 'bum'. Rigged attachments can't receive clicks.

2) Rez a cube as rootprim, name it 'Ruth2v4 spanker'

3) Apply the default transparent texture to the cube

4) Position the cube inside bum, and link the bum to it

5) Rez two spheres, each 0.2 in x/y/z size, with transparent texture applied

6) Name one sphere 'left', and the other 'right'

7) Position spheres roughly along the bum cheeks and link to the linkset

8) Copy animation, sound and script inside the rootprim

9) Take the linkset in inventory, attach to pelvis. This is important,
   otherwise the non-rigged clickable spheres won't cover the avi's bum.

10) Test if everything works


* Spheres can be repositioned if clicks aren't received well

* The full effect color and transparancy can be adjusted in the photoshop file
