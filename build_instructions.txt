
1) Rez rigged bum, name it 'bum'. Rigged attachments can't receive clicks.

2) Rez theme, name it 'Ruth2v4 spanker'

3) Apply textures 1 - 8 to faces 0 - 7 of the theme prim

4) Position theme inside bum, and link the bum to it

5) Rez two spheres, each 0.2 in x/y/z size, with transparent texture applied

6) Name one sphere 'left', and the other 'right'

7) Position spheres roughly along the bum cheeks and link to the linkset

8) Copy animation, sound and script inside the rootprim

9) Set the color of the linkset to bright red or dark red

9) Take the linkset in inventory, attach to pelvis. This is important,
   otherwise the non-rigged clickable spheres won't cover the avi's bum.

10) Test if everything works


* Spheres can be repositioned if clicks aren't received well

* Adjust color to your preference (can be done once for the entire linkset)
